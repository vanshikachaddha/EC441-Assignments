# EC 441 – Intro to Computer Networking  
Spring 2026  
Boston University  

This repository contains my weekly engagement artifacts for EC 441. Each week, I produce a problem, report, lab, or related technical exploration connected to the course material. Over the semester, this repository will serve as a portfolio demonstrating breadth across networking topics and layers.
